## How to use this plugin

**Option A:**

1. Download the `.zip` file and unzip it.
2. Place the folder inside your `moodle/public/mod/` directory.
3. Open a terminal, navigate to the `autogenquiz` folder, and run: `composer install`. This installs all required PHP dependencies.

**Option B (recommended for non-developers):**
1. Ask me for the `.zip` file that already includes the `vendor/` folder (all dependencies are preinstalled).
2. Then simply unzip it and place it inside your `moodle/public/mod/` folder â€” no extra steps needed.
